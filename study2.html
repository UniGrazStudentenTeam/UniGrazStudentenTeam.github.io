							<p>The authors created and validated an anxiety level prediction technology, based on the data 
								from a wristband (blood volume pressure, galvanic skin response, body temperature) meant to 
								be used in VR Exposure therapy. They trained and evaluated their model on 30 participants 
								undergoing a Virtual Reality Exposure treatment for public speaking.</p>

							<h3>What was done?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Development of a wearable that unobtrusiveley and continuously captures details of behavours and context to provide coues 
                            about anxiety onset

							<h3>What were the results?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
                            Process within device is possible
                            When speaking english, their body movement is stronger in correl to anxiety
                            Due to body is used to complete communication 
                            Inner anxiety state more reflected by acitom of the right hand (dominant)
                            Speech features (brughtness_sp and MFCC5_sp) to anxiety is 72.73%

							<h3>What can be concluded?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
                            The paper was a proposal of a platform and approach for the analysis of human physical and vocal activities in association 
                            with their anxiety. Severeal features of ativity and audio data that most relate to anxiety state has been found. A non intrusive 
                            and continuously way to collect acoustic and physical activity was designed and executed. Additionally, speech features extraction 
                            algorithm is in embedded in the wearable device and spares raw speech data recording.
