							<h3>What was done?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>The authors created and validated an anxiety level prediction technology, based on the data 
                            from a wristband (blood volume pressure, galvanic skin response, body temperature) meant to 
                            be used in VR Exposure therapy. They trained and evaluated their model on 30 participants 
                            undergoing a Virtual Reality Exposure treatment for public speaking.</p>

							<h3>What were the results?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>After various preprocessing steps, they were able to achieve a classification accuracy of <b> 80.1% </b> 
                            (leave one out) or <b> 86.3% </b>  (10x10 fold cross validation) with the Support Vector Machine classifier.
                             Furthermore they found that a 20s window length for the prediction yielded the highest accuracy.</p>

							<h3>What can be concluded?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>VR Exposure Therapy Systems can be used together with AI wearables that predict anxiety during the 
                            treatment with a considerable accuracy. This can in the future help to improve VR treatments to 
                            become more personalised and adaptive. </p>
