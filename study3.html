					<div class="panel">
					  <p>In this study Arsalan & Majid (2021) presented an anxiety detection framework based on the <b>
						EEG 
												(Electroencephalography)
					  </b>data collected from 65 participants. The study describes in detail 
                        the data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, and classification stages. 
                        Two approaches were developed: for the <b>binary</b>(anxious/non-anxious) and 
                        <b>multi-class</b>(non-anxious/low-anxious/high-anxious) classification. </p>

					<button class="accordion">What were the results?</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>After performing channel selection by using the t test (2 classes) and ANOVA (3 classes) <b>TP9 and AF8 </b>were 
                            found to be statistically significantly <b>different channels</b>. From those channels  5 time-domain features were 
                            selected for further classifier training. Out of Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Multilayer perceptron, 
                            <b>Random Forest classifier</b> yielded the best accuracy score for both 2 and 3 class problems,<b>
								 87.69 and 83.07,
								respectively.

					<button class="container accordion">What can be concluded?</button>
					<div class="container panel">
					  <p>When working with the EEG data it is crucial to perform thorough <b>channel and feature selection</b>. This will yield better 
                        results later on during the classifier training. The developed pipeline is able to differentiate not only between anxious 
                        and non-anxious classes, but also to distinguish the <b>level of anxiousness as well</b>. Authors demonstrated that it is possible
                         to provide a classification pipeline for anxiety using a <b>low-cost device</b> with only four channels. This setup can be 
                         integrated into daily life, not just in clinical settings.  </p>
