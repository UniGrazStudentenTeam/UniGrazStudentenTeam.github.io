					<div class="panel">
					  <p>In this study authors presented an anxiety detection framework based on the EEG 
                        (Electroencephalography) data collected from 65 participants. Paper describes in detail 
                        the data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, and classification stages. 
                        Two approaches were developed: for the binary(anxious/non-anxious) and 
                        multi-class(non-anxious/low-anxious/high-anxious) classification. </p>

					<button class="accordion">What were the results?</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>After performing channel selection by using the t test (2 classes) and ANOVA (3 classes) TP9 and AF8 were 
                            found to be statistically significantly different channels. From those channels  5 time-domain features were 
                            selected for further classifier training. Out of Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Multilayer perceptron, 
                            Random Forest classifier yielded the best accuracy score for both 2 and 3 class problems, 87.69 and 83.07, 
                            respectively. </p>

					<button class="container accordion">What can be concluded?</button>
					<div class="container panel">
					  <p>When working with the EEG data it is crucial to perform thorough channel and feature selection. This will yield better 
                        results later on during the classifier training. The developed pipeline is able to differentiate not only between anxious 
                        and non-anxious classes, but also to distinguish the level of anxiousness as well. Authors demonstrated that it is possible
                         to provide a classification pipeline for anxiety using a low-cost device with only four channels. This setup can be 
                         integrated into daily life, not just in clinical settings.  </p>
