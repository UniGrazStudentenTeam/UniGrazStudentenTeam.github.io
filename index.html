						<h2>Wearable Artificial Intelligence for Detecting Anxiety: 
							Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</h2>
					</header>
					<section>
						<header>
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<!-- <p>This is the subtitle for this particular heading</p> -->
						</header>
						<p>Annually millions of people are being diagnosed with Anxiety Disorders (ADs), with anxiety being the 
							<b>most common</b> mental health issue in the U.S. and Europe. ADs have a significant negative  effect on the 
							life of an individual by making them experience intense and persistent worry about daily situations, 
							interfering with their job performance, academic success and social relationships.
							Traditional ways to diagnose anxiety focus on <b>self-reported surveys and interview-based assessment methods</b> 
							conducted by clinicians. These methods have many limitations, among which are reproducibility issues and 
							the lack of medical mental health professionals worldwide. This results in anxiety being often left 
							underdetected and undertreated. <br>
							
							Advancements in digital technologies and wireless sensors have led to the widespread development of <b>
							wearable healthcare devices </b>, which offer a new way of monitoring individuals' health. Such devices allow individuals
							to track various health features, such as heart rate, sleep pattern, blood oxygen, which can be important 
							indicators of anxiety levels.<br>
							The latest wearable health tracking devices incorporate <b>Artificial Intelligence(AI) algorithms</b> into them, 
							allowing not only for the data monitoring and data collection, but also an in-depth analysis of the gathered 
							data. Wearable AI devices collect the data, preprocess it and analyse it in order to efficiently detect anxiety
							symptoms. Wearable AI can prove to be an effective and low-cost technology to help individuals with 
							their anxiety. The meta-analysis of Abd-alrazaq and colleagues provides an insight on the state of the Wearable AI 
							for detecting anxiety and the possibility of it being implemented in clinical practice.</p>

							<h3>What is this study about?</h3>
							<!-- <p>This is the subtitle for this particular heading</p> -->
						</header>
						<p>The systematic review and meta-analysis examines how <b>effective </b>various Wearable Artificial Intelligence (AI) - wrist, 
							head and chest-worn - devices are in <b>detecting and predicting anxiety</b>.  The main goal of the review is to evaluate the 
							performance of wearable AI technologies, which use AI algorithms trained on wearable device data to identify anxiety symptoms 
							automatically, objectively and efficiently, on the basis of all relevant data types(Sleep data, EEG data, Heart rate data, etc.)
							 collected by wearable devices.<br>

							Eight electronic databases (MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO), ACM Digital Library, 
							Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant studies that utilised wearable devices to detect anxiety. 
							The authors were able to identify 918 records, out of <b>which 21 studies,</b> published between 2016 and 2022, were selected for the 
							review. The studies were checked for the risk of bias using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy 
							Studies–Revised.<br>
							
							The authors first analysed to what extent wearable AI can correctly classify patients with and without anxiety. Further analysis
							 was conducted on <b>how specific factors</b> like the wearable device type, placement of the device, aim of AI algorithm being detection 
							 or classification, type of AI algorithm, data type, data source, validation approach <b>influence the performance</b> of wearable AI.
							</p>

							<h3>What are the results of the study?</h3>
							<!-- <p>This is the subtitle for this particular heading</p> -->
						</header>
						<p>Meta-analyses were conducted to assess the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of wearable AI. Subgroup comparisons were 
							performed based on different AI algorithms, AI objectives, wearable devices, device status, data types, data sources, reference 
							standards, and validation methods. Due to the use of multiple algorithms in some studies, the authors were able to extract more than 
							one estimate per study.<br>
							
							<b>Accuracy</b> is the AI's ability to correctly classify patients with and without anxiety. Out of 17/21 eligible studies, 40 accuracy 
							estimates involving 149,909 participants were derived. The range of highest accuracies spanned from 0.50 to 1.00, with an <b>
								overall accuracy of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.89).
							</b><br>
							
									-> This means that out of 100 cases of participants, 82 get classified correctly 
										 as experiencing anxiety and 18 do not.<br>
										
							<b>Sensitivity</b>, the correct detection of participants with anxiety, was assessed in 10/21 eligible studies, yielding 24 sensitivity 
							estimates across 97,794 participants. The highest sensitivity ranged from 0.21 to 1.00, with a pooled mean sensitivity of 
							<b>0.79 (95% CI 0.57-0.91). </b><br>
							
									->This means that out of 100 cases of participants experiencing anxiety, 79 get 
										correctly  classified and 21 do not.<br>
							
							
							<b>Specificity</b>, the correct identification of participants without anxiety, was analyzed in 10/21 eligible studies, resulting in 
							24 specificity estimates across 45,555 participants. The pooled mean specificity was <b>0.92 (95% CI 0.68-0.98).</b> <br>
							
									-> That means that out of 100 cases of participants without anxiety, 92 get 
										 identified correctly and 8 do not.<br>
							
							
							In the subgroup analyses of influence by various factors on performance domains, despite there being considerable differences in the
							 accuracy for example for different algorithms, <b>no statistically significant </b>influences were found. This does not imply the absence of 
							 different influences; rather, it suggests that the eligible subgroups might have just been too limited to yield statistical significant 
							 differences.
							
							</p>

							<h3>How do we rate the meta analysis?</h3>
							<!-- <p>This is the subtitle for this particular heading</p> -->
						</header>
						<p><b>How big is the effect found in this meta-analysis?</b><br>
							This meta analysis yielded an average classification accuracy of 0.82 based on the data of 149,909 participants overall examined. 
							The authors rate this to be quite good, however it is not optimal and hence not suitable for clinical use without any additional 
							diagnostics yet.<br>
							The sensitivity and specificity are also calculated, based on half of the studies: A pooled mean sensitivity of 0.79 and a pooled 
							mean specificity of 0.92 show that the AI algorithms used in combination with the data from the wearable devices are better at detecting 
							persons who are not suffering from anxiety than those who are. This might be due to the fact that in most of the studies there were more
							 people not suffering from anxiety which led to a larger database for the persons not suffering from anxiety. 
							The heterogeneity among the studies in the analysis of influencing factors shows, these measures did systematically depend on the type of
							AI used, the aims of the AI, the wearable devices, the status of the wearable devices, the data types/sources, the reference standards of
							the validation methods which contradicts the authors expectations as an influence of e.g. the algorithm used was shown for detecting 
							depression (SOURCE).  <br>
							
							<b>How specific are these findings?</b><br>
							As mentioned before, the authors assessed a substantial number of possible influencing factors such as the AI algorithm used (Support 
							Vector Machine, Random forest etc.), the aims of AI (detection vs. prediction), the wearable device used (FitBit, Muse etc.) and its 
							status (commercial vs. non commercial), the data sources and types used for training, the reference standard used for validating the
							 outcomes of the algorithms (STAI Questionnaire, CIDI Questionnaire etc.) and the validation methods used (K-fold, Hold-out). They 
							 calculated the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for each of those different options and hence provide a broad overview over how
							  the studies differ in those 3 measures depending on the methods used. One limitation to consider in this context however, is that the
							   number of studies in the subgroup analyses was quite small (for example they only included 2 studies for the logistic regression 
							   algorithm) and therefore it is difficult to detect differences between the subgroups (influencing factors). Furthermore they provided 
							   data on where the study was conducted, the year of publication etc. To conclude, the findings of this meta analysis are very specific 
							   and provide a good overview over the field and the techniques used.<br>
							
							<b>How generally does this apply?</b><br>
							As mentioned before, the meta analysis did consider a substantial amount of influencing factors, but the tests within the groups of a factor 
							(e.g. the different types of AI algorithm used) yielded that within none of these moderators one option performs significantly better than the 
							others regarding accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. This leads to the conclusion that the findings mentioned in the meta analysis are 
							consistent over the different methods and influencing factors and even though there was some heterogeneity among the reported accuracies, specificities 
							and sensitivities the reported findings can be generalised to some extent.<br>
							However as mentioned earlier they had a very small number of studies in the subgroups, hence these findings should be taken “with a grain of salt”. 
							Furthermore the authors did not differentiate between the different types of anxiety (for example phobias, panic etc.) and the number of included studies
							 was still limited (the final accuracy was based on just 19 studies).<br>
							
							<b>What makes the study scientifically relevant?</b><br>
							This meta analysis is the first one to assess the performance of wearable AI in predicting anxiety. While there has already been a meta analysis 
							estimating the overall performance of AI in detecting depression (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2023) this is the first to assess the performance in anxiety.
							 It therefore provides a first overview and summary of the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of AI wearables for detecting anxiety, which is critically 
							 important to the development of new technologies and their clinical use. It also shows new potential for research to further investigate the performance 
							 of such devices in diagnosing anxiety disorders, managing anxiety or other devices to assess biomarkers. <br>
							
							<b>How methodologically credible are the findings?</b><br>
							To ensure methodological credibility the authors of the meta analysis followed the PRISMA and PROSPERO guidelines in reporting their findings and screening 
							process and only included studies from after 2015 which is reasonable, considering the rapid technological advances. Furthermore, they used the QUADAS-2
							 method to assess the risk of bias in their studies.<br>
							It should be mentioned however, that the authors did not put any restrictions on the study design or the data quality, which is an understandable choice, 
							given that the field is still quite new and there are not that many high quality studies (randomised control trials) published to this date. Furthermore just 
							29% of the studies that were assessed had a low risk of bias and the sample size was small (&lt; 100) in two-thirds of the included studies. Also, the accuracy 
							of the wearable AI to detect anxiety might be slightly overestimated as the authors always picked the highest accuracy reported in the studies they included 
							and disregarded the lower ones.<br>

							<h3>What can be concluded from these results?</h3>
							<!-- <p>This is the subtitle for this particular heading</p> -->
						</header>
						<p><b>What are the practical implications of this meta analysis for the field of clinical psychology?</b><br>
							On average, the AI wearable devices can correctly detect whether a person is suffering from anxiety or not in 82% of the cases. While this
							 definitely shows great potential in the field of AI wearables, this performance is still not optimal, the sample studies of most included
							  studies were small and only a few of them were classified as a low risk of bias. Hence AI wearables should not be used solely for clinical 
							  diagnosis, however data from AI wearables can be used as additional information in the diagnostic process, aside other clinical assessments 
							  such as symptom inventories, self assessments or clinical interviews. Another limitation is that these AI devices cannot yet differentiate between the 
							  different types of anxiety (PTSD, panic disorder, phobias etc.). To conclude, AI wearables can and should be integrated in the clinical process of diagnosing
							   anxiety, however they should not be used as the only measure.<br>
							
							<b>What are the practical implications of this meta analysis for the field of AI - wearable development?</b><br>
							From the technological perspective the field of AI wearables still has large potential: <br>
							</p>
							<ol class="default">
								<li>None of the commercial wearable AI devices had the algorithms to detect anxiety embedded within the device, which however would be needed to promptly 
									identify anxiety or causes of it.</li>
								<li>The currently assessed devices were mainly focussed on predicting anxiety at the current point of time, but also predicting the future anxiety levels
									is just as important.</li>
								<li>There is still a big discrepancy between the accuracy of detecting persons with anxiety vs. detecting persons without anxiety - therefore the AI algorithms 
									need to be refined to close that gap.</li>
								<li>The data quality from the wearable devices is still quite low: in the future a consistent measurement, methods to control for outlines, missing data, 
									artefacts (such as hand movements etc.) and better sensors must be developed to ensure good data quality and hence better performance in detecting/predicting 
									anxiety</li>
								<li>Lastly, other biomarkers such as brain activity (EEG) could be integrated into the process to ensure an even better performance in detecting anxiety.</li>
							</ol>

							<b>Personal use: should I wear an AI empowered smart-watch to detect my anxiety levels?</b><br>
							While AI powered devices are not capable of precise detection of anxiety yet, they can provide useful information on whether or how often you might be 
							experiencing anxiety.<br>
							However, to get an accurate diagnosis, followed up with an adequate treatment in case you are persistently suffering from anxiety you should definitely 
							consult a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist to get professional help.
