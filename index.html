								<div class="panel">
								<p>Annually millions of people are being diagnosed with Anxiety Disorders (ADs), with anxiety being the 
									<b>most common</b> mental health issue in the U.S. and Europe. ADs have a significant negative  effect on the 
									life of an individual by making them experience intense and persistent worry about daily situations, 
									interfering with their job performance, academic success and social relationships.
									Traditional ways to diagnose anxiety focus on <b>self-reported surveys and interview-based assessment methods</b> 
									conducted by clinicians. These methods have many limitations, among which are reproducibility issues and 
									the lack of medical mental health professionals worldwide. This results in anxiety being often left 
									underdetected and undertreated. <br>
									
									Advancements in digital technologies and wireless sensors have led to the widespread development of <b>
									wearable healthcare devices </b>, which offer a new way of monitoring individuals' health. Such devices allow individuals
									to track various health features, such as heart rate, sleep pattern, blood oxygen, which can be important 
									indicators of anxiety levels.<br>
									The latest wearable health tracking devices incorporate <b>Artificial Intelligence(AI) algorithms</b> into them, 
									allowing not only for the data monitoring and data collection, but also an in-depth analysis of the gathered 
									data. <b>Wearable AI devices</b> collect the data, preprocess it and analyse it in order to efficiently detect anxiety
									symptoms. Wearable AI can prove to be an<b> effective and low-cost technology </b>to help individuals with 
									their anxiety. The meta-analysis of Abd-alrazaq and colleagues provides an insight on the state of the Wearable AI 
									for detecting anxiety and the possibility of it being implemented in clinical practice.</p>
								</div> <br><br>
							
							<button class="accordion">What is the study about?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								<p>The systematic review and meta-analysis examines how <b>effective </b>various Wearable Artificial Intelligence (AI) - wrist, 
									head and chest-worn - devices are in <b>detecting and predicting anxiety</b>.  The main goal of the review is to evaluate the 
									performance of wearable AI technologies, which use AI algorithms trained on wearable device data to identify anxiety symptoms 
									automatically, objectively and efficiently, on the basis of all relevant data types(Sleep data, EEG data, Heart rate data, etc.)
									 collected by wearable devices.<br>
		
									Eight electronic databases (MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO), ACM Digital Library, 
									Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant studies that utilised wearable devices to detect anxiety. 
									The authors were able to identify 918 records, out of <b>which 21 studies,</b> published between 2016 and 2022, were selected for the 
									review. The studies were checked for the risk of bias using a <b>modified</b> version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy 
									Studies–Revised.<br>
									
									The authors first analysed to what extent wearable AI can correctly classify patients with and without anxiety. Further analysis
									 was conducted on <b>how specific factors</b> like the wearable device type, placement of the device, aim of AI algorithm being detection 
									 or classification, type of AI algorithm, data type, data source, validation approach <b>influence the performance</b> of wearable AI.</p>
								</div> <br><br>
							
							<button class="accordion">What were the results of this study?</button>
								<div class="panel">
								<p>Meta-analyses were conducted to assess the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of wearable AI. Subgroup comparisons were 
									performed based on different AI algorithms, AI objectives, wearable devices, device status, data types, data sources, reference 
									standards, and validation methods. Due to the use of multiple algorithms in some studies, the authors were able to extract more than 
									one estimate per study.<br>
									
									<b>Accuracy</b> is the AI's ability to correctly classify patients with and without anxiety. Out of 17/21 eligible studies, 40 accuracy 
									estimates involving 149,909 participants were derived. The range of highest accuracies spanned from 0.50 to 1.00, with an <b>
										overall accuracy of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.89).
									</b><br>

									<div class="small-box">
										<i>This means that out of 100 cases of participants, 82 get classified correctly 
											as experiencing anxiety or not and 18 get "wrongly diagnosed" either with or without anxiety.</i>
									</div>
									
									<p><b>Sensitivity</b>, the correct detection of participants with anxiety, was assessed in 10/21 eligible studies, yielding 24 sensitivity 
										estimates across 97,794 participants. The highest sensitivity ranged from 0.21 to 1.00, with a pooled mean sensitivity of 
										<b>0.79 (95% CI 0.57-0.91). </b></p> 
									
									<div class="small-box">
										<i>This means that out of 100 cases of participants experiencing anxiety, 79 get 
											correctly identified and 21 do not get identified as having anxiety.</i>
									</div>
									
									<p><b>Specificity</b>, the correct identification of participants without anxiety, was analyzed in 10/21 eligible studies, resulting in 
										24 specificity estimates across 45,555 participants. The pooled mean specificity was <b>0.92 (95% CI 0.68-0.98).</b></p>
									
									<div class="small-box">
										<i>That means that out of 100 cases of participants without anxiety, 92 get 
											identified correctly and 8 wrongly get identified as suffering from anxiety.</i>
									</div>
									
									<p>In the subgroup analyses of influence by various factors on performance domains, despite there being considerable differences in the
										accuracy for example for different algorithms, <b>no statistically significant </b>influences were found. This does not imply the absence of 
										different influences; rather, it suggests that the eligible subgroups might have just been too limited to yield statistical significant 
										differences.</p>
								</div> <br><br>
							
							<button class="accordion">How do we rate the Meta Analysis?</button>
							<div class="panel">
							<p> To rate this study, we asked five questions, based on the <b>Abelson (1995) criteria:</b> <br><br>
								<b>How big is the effect found in this meta-analysis?</b><br>
								This meta analysis yielded a <b>good but not optimal</b> average classification accuracy of <b>0.82 </b>based on the examined data 149,909 participants. 
								The <b>sensitivity and specificity</b> are also calculated, based on half of the studies: A pooled mean sensitivity of 0.79 and a pooled 
								mean specificity of 0.92 show that the AI algorithms used in combination with the data from the wearable devices are better at detecting 
								persons who are <b>not suffering</b> from anxiety than those who are. This might be due to the fact that in most of the studies there were more
								 people not suffering from anxiety which led to a larger database for the persons not suffering from anxiety. 
								Even though there is considerable heterogeneity among the studies and their accuracies, these measures did <b>not</b> systematically depend 
								on the type of AI used, the aims of the AI, the wearable devices, the status of the wearable devices, the data types/sources, the reference standards of
								the validation methods which contradicts the authors expectations as an influence of e.g. the algorithm used was shown for detecting 
								depression (Abd-Alrazaq et al 2023).  <br><br>
								
								<b>How specific are these findings?</b><br>
								The authors provide descriptive information about all the included studies on where the study was conducted, the year of publication etc. 
								Moreover, a substantial number of possible <b>influencing factors</b> such as the AI algorithm used (Support 
								Vector Machine, Random forest etc.), the aims of AI (detection vs. prediction), the wearable device used (FitBit, Muse etc.) and its 
								status (commercial vs. non commercial), the data sources and types used for training, the reference standard used for validating the
								 outcomes of the algorithms (STAI Questionnaire, CIDI Questionnaire etc.) and the validation methods used (K-fold, Hold-out). They 
								 calculated the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity <b>for each of those different options</b> and hence provide a broad overview over how
								  the studies differ in those 3 measures depending on the methods used. <br>
								However one important limitation to consider in this context however, is that the
								number of studies in the <b>subgroup analyses was small</b> (for example they only included 2 studies for the logistic regression 
								algorithm) and therefore it is difficult to detect differences between the subgroups (influencing factors). Having such small subgroups 
								severely impacts the specificity of these findings, given that it is hard to detect differences between such small groups. 
								Furthermore, the authors did not differentiate between the different types of anxiety (for example phobias, panic etc.) and most of the
								studies included were based on healthy adults leaving the question whether persons suffering from mental illness have a better chance
								of being detected by the AI wearables.  <br><br>
								   
								<b>How generally does this apply?</b><br>
								The subgroup tests between the groups of a factor (e.g. the different types of AI algorithm used) were all non significant,
								meaning that within <b>none</b> of these moderators one option performs <b>significantly better </b>than the 
								others regarding accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. This leads to the conclusion that the findings mentioned in the meta analysis are 
								consistent over the different methods and indicates some generalizabiliy. However, the amount of studies was still <b>limited</b> 
								(the final accuracy was based on just 19 studies) and the <b>data quality</b> was low, as they did not put any restrictions on 
								study design (e.g. control groups, randomization etc.).<br><br>
								
								<b>What makes the study scientifically relevant?</b><br>
								This meta analysis is the <b>first one</b> to assess the performance of wearable AI in predicting anxiety. While there has already been a meta analysis 
								estimating the overall performance of AI in detecting depression (Abd-Alrazaq et al, 2023) this is the first to assess the performance in anxiety.
								 It therefore provides a first overview and summary of the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of AI wearables for detecting anxiety, which is critically 
								 important to the development of new technologies and their clinical use. It also shows <b>new potential for research </b>to further investigate the performance 
								 of wearable devices in diagnosing anxiety disorders or managing anxiety and gives future implications for AI and wearable development<br><br>
								
								<b>How methodologically credible are the findings?</b><br>
								To ensure methodological credibility the authors of the meta analysis followed the <b>PRISMA </b>and <b>PROSPERO</b> guidelines in reporting their findings and screening 
								process and only included studies from after 2015 which is reasonable, considering the rapid technological advances. Furthermore, they used the QUADAS-2
								 method to <b>assess the risk of bias</b> in their studies.<br>
								It should be mentioned however, that the authors did<b> not put any restrictions</b> on the study design or the data quality, which is an understandable choice, 
								given that the field is still quite new and there are not that many high quality studies (randomised control trials) published to this date. Furthermore just 
								29% of the studies that were assessed had a<b> low </b>risk of bias and the sample size was small (&lt; 100) in <b>two-thirds</b> of the included studies. Also, the accuracy 
								of the wearable AI to detect anxiety might be slightly overestimated as the authors always picked the <b>highest accuracy reported</b> in the studies they included 
								and disregarded the lower ones.<br><br>
								
								<b>To conclude:</b><br> The meta analysis by Abd-Alrazaq et al is the first of its kind, to assess the performance of wearable AI to detect and predict anxiety and
								therefore provides an important first summary of the field as well as implications for future research. The results however have to be regarded carefully due to 
								their limitations regarding specificity, generalizabiliy and credibility and hence should not be taken as the "absolute" proof for AI efficieny in detecting anxiety.</p>

							<button class="accordion">What can be concluded from these results?</button>
							<div class="panel">
							<p></header>
								<p><b>What are the practical implications of this meta analysis for the field of clinical psychology?</b><br>
									On average, the AI wearable devices can correctly detect whether a person is suffering from anxiety or not in 82% of the cases. While this
									 definitely shows <b>great potential in the field of AI wearables,</b> this performance is still not optimal, the sample studies of most included
									  studies were small and only a few of them were classified as a low risk of bias. Hence AI wearables should<b> not </b>be used solely for clinical 
									  diagnosis, however data from AI wearables can be used as <b>additional information</b> in the diagnostic process, aside other clinical assessments 
									  such as symptom inventories, self assessments or clinical interviews. Another limitation is that these AI devices cannot yet differentiate between the 
									  different types of anxiety (PTSD, panic disorder, phobias etc.). To conclude, AI wearables can and should be integrated in the clinical process of diagnosing
									   anxiety, however they should<b> not</b> be used as the<b> only measure.</b><br><br>
									
									<b>What are the practical implications of this meta analysis for the field of AI - wearable development?</b><br>
									From the technological perspective the field of AI wearables still has large potential:
									</p>
									<ol class="default">
										<li>None of the commercial wearable AI devices had the algorithms to detect anxiety <b>embedded within the device,</b> which however would be needed to promptly 
											identify anxiety or causes of it.</li>
										<li>The currently assessed devices were mainly focussed on detecting anxiety at the current point of time, but also <b>predicting</b> the future anxiety levels
											is just as important.</li>
										<li>There is still a big discrepancy between the accuracy of detecting persons <b>with anxiety vs. detecting persons without</b> anxiety - therefore the AI algorithms 
											need to be refined to close that gap.</li>
										<li>The<b> data quality</b> from the wearable devices is still quite low: in the future a consistent measurement, methods to control for <b>
											outlines, missing data,
												artefacts
										</b>(such as hand movements etc.) and <b>better sensors </b>must be developed to ensure good data quality and hence better performance in detecting/predicting 
											anxiety</li>
									</ol>
									<p>
									<b>Personal use: should I wear an AI empowered smart-watch to detect my anxiety levels?</b><br>
									While AI powered devices are not capable of <b>precise detection of anxiety yet,</b> they can provide <b>useful information </b>on whether or how often you might be 
									experiencing anxiety.<br>
									However, to get an accurate diagnosis, followed up with an adequate treatment in case you are p<b>ersistently suffering from anxiety</b> you should  
									consult a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist to get <b>professional help.</b></p>
